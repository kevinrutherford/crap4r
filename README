This project will contain a tool to compute the CRAP metric for Ruby code.

This current version looks for all files called ./spec/**/*_spec.rb,
runs them using Rspec, and reports the cyclomatic complexity for
all methods defined in all files tested.

Run it like this:

  ruby -Ilib /path/to/crap4r
